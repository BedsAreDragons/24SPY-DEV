# [24SPY](https://tiaguinho2009.github.io/24SPY/)

**24SPY** is a developing platform designed to display real-time information about aircraft and ATC controllers currently online on the ATC24 server, similar to VATSIM Radar. This project serves both as a functional tool and a way to enhance my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills while contributing to the virtual aviation community.

Though still in early stages, the site may eventually support live ATC data. Achieving this will depend on recognition and support from the ATC24 team.
